# SSHelper
A very (Visual) basic GUI to execute SSH to connect to remote servers. If you wish to get just the command without executing it, it can do that too.
Built with .NET Framework 2.0, theoretically, yes, you *can* launch it on Windows 98/ME as that's the last officially supported version of .NET Framework that runs on those versions of Windows... don't expect it to work there, however, lol.

This is a result of boredom, for the most part.
